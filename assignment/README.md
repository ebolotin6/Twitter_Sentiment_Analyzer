# Final project proposal, Data Science 710 

Answer the questions in `projectproposal.docx` about your plans for the final project, and submit the resulting file to GitHub in .docx or .pdf format, preferably pdf.  

Your project proposal can be fairly short (1/2 to 1 page), as long as it addresses all 5 questions in projectproposal.docx.
